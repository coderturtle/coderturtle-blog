<Layout title="About the Coderturtle">
  <h1 class="text-3xl font-mono text-green-700 mb-4">Who is the Coderturtle?</h1>
  <p class="mb-4">
    The Coderturtle is a creature of curious contradictions: part architect, part chaos monkey. Equal parts caffeine and config files.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    This site documents the journey of an AI Architect in the making â€” fumbling through Terraform states, dodging YAML explosions, and experimenting with platform blueprints that may or may not involve cartoon turtles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Inspired by the likes of Coding Horror, but with a softer shell and stranger metaphors. If you're here for practical wisdom, war stories, and the occasional ASCII turtle, you're in the right place.
