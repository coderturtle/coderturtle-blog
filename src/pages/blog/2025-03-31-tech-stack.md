Welcome to Coderturtle 🐢 — a blog that documents the messy, creative, and insightful journey of an aspiring AI architect.

### 🧠 Why This Stack?

Coderturtle is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), a static site generator that lets us write in Markdown while using modern frameworks like React when needed. It's fast, modular, and ideal for content-heavy sites.

Here’s the breakdown:

- **Astro** for performance + flexibility
- **Tailwind CSS** for quick custom styling
- **Markdown/MDX** for writing
- **GitHub Pages** for free hosting
- **Custom domain**: `coderturtle.io`

### 🚀 How to Set It Up Yourself

1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `npm install`  
3. Run `npm run dev` to start developing  
4. Push to `main` — GitHub Actions will deploy the site!

And that’s it — blogging, the Coderturtle way.
